# wp-sitemap-update
To trigger Google to re-crawl and re-evaluate those URLs, you need to update the “Last Modified” timestamps of your key product and content pages.
You can run this once using a plugin like Code Snippets or add it temporarily to your theme’s functions.php.

Then visit the site eg: [https://globaliweb.com/gmail-for-business-email](https://globaliweb.com/gmail-for-business-email/) lke page, post, product, category, tags, etc.

You should see updated <lastmod> dates for the edited pages/products
